                    <p class="post-date">October 29, 2020</p>
                    <p>Mount Rushmore National Memorial features the faces of four U.S. presidents. All, of course, are men, but Congress considered a bill in 1936 supporting the addition of a female figure to the granite memorial. Do you know which woman might have joined George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln?</p>
                    <p>The four presidential faces carved into Mount Rushmore seem, well, set in stone, but it wasn’t always the case. Doane Robinson, a South Dakota historian who came up with the idea of carving large figures into the Black Hills as a way to attract tourists to his state, originally envisioned showcasing the likes of Buffalo Bill Cody, Meriwether Lewis, William Clark and Red Cloud, a legendary Lakota leader. Looking for a sculptor, Robinson contacted Gutzon Borglum, whose project memorializing Confederate leaders at Stone Mountain in Georgia was floundering because of disagreements with his patrons. Borglum visited the area in 1925 and settled on Mount Rushmore as a suitable site. He also decided which faces were to be included in the memorial. Borglum thought the purpose of the sculptures was to memorialize “the founding, expansion, preservation and unification of the United States.” To that end, he picked Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt. Carving had just started in 1927 when Rose Arnold Powell wrote to President Calvin Coolidge, who had attended Mount Rushmore’s dedication ceremony, and made the case for women’s rights activist Susan B. Anthony to be included in the memorial. A few years earlier, while in her mid-40s, Powell had read a biography of Anthony that inspired her to dedicate much of her life to secure widespread recognition for the famed social reformer and the achievements of other women overlooked by history. To Powell, the absence of a woman on Mount Rushmore was conspicuous (though some early visitors did mistake Jefferson’s face for that of First Lady Martha Washington), and her quest to repair the omission was yet another effort toward gender equality. “Our greatest heroines should be honored with our much-lauded heroes,” she said later. “Many a thrilling story of feminine heroism lies buried, which if resurrected would inject an element which in American life is missing, and it would deflate masculine superiority.</p>
