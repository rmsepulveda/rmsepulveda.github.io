Moab Giants is the ultimate place to discover the past with cutting edge technology that feels like the future! This Dinosaur Park is full of attractions that both educate and entertain. The virtual 5D PaleoAquarium takes you into a deep-sea laboratory where prehistoric sea-creatures can be observed and genetically revealed.</p>
                    <p>Experience the excitement and fun offered in both hands-on and virtual activities and feel the curiosity and wonder of being a kid again!

From the friendly sea-turtles to an intense encounter with a Megalodon, this adrenaline rush is one you won’t want to miss! Travel back through time along with a half-mile-long trail with more than 100 full-size replicas of the dinosaurs in the area and the footprints they left behind! The desert landscape also boasts a breath-taking view of Arches National Park, La Sal Mountains, and Moab’s geologically famous red-rocks! The Theater introduces the magic of the creation and early history of the universe from the Big Bang to the Age of Dinosaurs. You’ll get the full effect of creation and prehistoric life in 3D before being introduced into the open landscape where things come to life.</p>
