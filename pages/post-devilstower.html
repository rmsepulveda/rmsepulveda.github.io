                    <p>Driving through the rolling hills of northeast Wyoming we pass by vast grasslands, quiet ranches, and small country towns. The scenery is peaceful, undisturbed, and my mind easily wanders to scenes of the Wild West. Lost in thought, I imagine the Sundance Kid causing havoc in these parts, stealing guns and horses, establishing his reputation as an outlaw.</p>
                    <p>As we come up over a hill, I’m jolted from my daydream by the sight that sits before us. Off in the distance is a curious stone pillar, rising high above the surrounding plains. It seems to come out of nowhere, clashing with the grassy fields before it. There are no mountains in view, or even any other large rocks. Just grasslands, pine forests and this one of a kind natural wonder- Devils Tower. Devils Tower is a flat-topped, igneous intrusion that looms 1,267 feet (386 m), above <b>Wyoming’s</b> eastern plains and the Belle Fourche River Valley. When I first saw <u>Devils Tower</u>, I couldn’t help but wonder how it was formed. And no, I didn’t think it was put there by aliens, even though it does look out of this world! Geologists agree that Devils Tower was formed by forcible entry of magma into or between other rock formations (intrusion), but there is some disagreement on how this process took place.
                    One theory is that Devils Tower is an eroded remnant of a laccolith (large mass of igneous rock which intrudes though sedimentary rock beds but doesn’t reach the surface). Other theories are that Devils Tower is a volcanic plug or the neck of an extinct volcano. Either way, erosion has played a part in exposing this mass of rock that has since become an important historical and spiritual landmark.</p>
